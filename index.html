            <h3>Music Brings Us The Peace</h3>
            <p>With seven notes, and few scales. Music comes to life. Those continuous sounds with a certain pitch and rhythm combined with the lyrics, expressing the emotion of the composer of the music. I would like to say that music brings us the peace we want.</p>
            <p>Music is composed by composer, and composer experience their life and express the feeling and emotions from their daily life. They transform those feeling and emotions into music notes and rhythms. It is like how we tell the stories to the others. Music is their language; the audiences can resonate with the music. To be honest, the most peaceful time for me, is when I am listening to the music I want, trying to feel the information passed from different instruments makes me feels peaceful. The sound of piano quiet did a good job in clam down the person’s mood.</p>

            <p>Some people may say some of the music types like Rock and Metal, they are kind of aggressive, and how could those kinds of music bring us the peace. I’ve to admit that there are music types that contains anger and mad indeed. But that music can help you to release the anger inside you which may comes from the unhappy of your life.  So, so how it did make you calm down in some way, didn’t it? The amazing world expressing from the music is what we want to bring us the safety.</p>

            <h3>Different Falimy Relationship Between Chinese And American</h3>
            <p>So, in the history course I took this semester, there is a unit talks about the relations of Chinese family is so different with the American family. As a Chinese, I would like to talk about the relationships in a family and the position difference according to the age.</p>            
            <p>In a Chinese family, we always have a strong connection among 3-4 generations. So, living with grandparents are common situations in China. Unlike the American family, in China, the elder man in a family always have a greater power and right than the younger members. The younger generation will always listen to the elder generation due to the Chinese tradition, which in my opinion, this is something unacceptable. Although they might have more experience than the younger generation, but I do not think that they have a better understand in modern social than the younger generation.</p>
            <p>In my family, my dad used to force me must listen to him and do what he said, which makes me super uncomfortable and I cannot understand why I should listen to him. And every time I ask him about this question, he always reply me that because he is my father and older than me and experience more than me. Until the last few years, something in his mind has changed, and he is trying to be a friend of me instead of an owner. Which I think that is something the whole Chinese need to learn about. Just like the American family, everyone is equal.</p>
