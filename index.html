            <h2>Music Brings Us The Peace</h2>
            <p>With seven notes, and few scales. Music comes to life. Those continuous sounds with a certain pitch and rhythm combined with the lyrics, expressing the emotion of the composer of the music. I would like to say that music brings us the peace we want.</p>
            <p>Music is composed by composer, and composer experience their life and express the feeling and emotions from their daily life. They transform those feeling and emotions into music notes and rhythms. It is like how we tell the stories to the others. Music is their language; the audiences can resonate with the music. To be honest, the most peaceful time for me, is when I am listening to the music I want, trying to feel the information passed from different instruments makes me feels peaceful. The sound of piano quiet did a good job in clam down the person’s mood.</p>
            <p>Some people may say some of the music types like Rock and Metal, they are kind of aggressive, and how could those kinds of music bring us the peace. I’ve to admit that there are music types that contains anger and mad indeed. But that music can help you to release the anger inside you which may comes from the unhappy of your life.  So, so how it did make you calm down in some way, didn’t it? The amazing world expressing from the music is what we want to bring us the safety.</p>
